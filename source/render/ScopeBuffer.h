/**
    An off-screen target for one stage of the scope.

    Three things on top of the SDK's FFGLFBO, the first two shared with
    `old-cathode`'s PassBuffer and the third specific to measuring.

    **It reallocates only when it has to.** `Ensure()` runs every frame and is a
    no-op in almost all of them; it only rebuilds when the scope's rectangle or
    the composition size actually changes.

    **It actually frees its colour texture.** `ffglex::FFGLFBO::Release()`
    deletes the framebuffer and the depth renderbuffer, then tests
    `depthBufferID` a second time where it plainly meant `colorTextureID` --
    leaking the colour texture on every release (SDK b1afaf9, `FFGLFBO.cpp`). One
    leak would not matter. This buffer is rebuilt whenever the operator drags the
    Size slider, so it would be one leak per frame of the drag.

    **It can be told to sample NEAREST.** The SDK always sets `GL_LINEAR`. That
    is right for the scope image on its way to the output, and wrong for the
    histogram's bin texture, where a linear tap silently averages neighbouring
    bins and reports counts that were never measured.
